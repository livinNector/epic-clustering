    "text": "This site is contains visualizations about different coding patterns observed from different OPPEs.\nThese are 10 programming problems from 24 September OPPE 1. In these visualizations each data point corresponds to individual code submission.\nWe created a 2D representation of these code submissions using an BERT-based model called Codesage. Which we clustered to find meaningful and interpretable clusters.\nThese names to the cluster were generated by an LLM summarizing the submissions.\n\nYou can hover over to see individual code submissions.\nZoom in by selecting a region.\nClick on the lables in the legend on the side to toggle the data points belonging to that clusters.\n\nNote that these only contain a subset of all the submissions which are grouped as clusters.\nYou may find different patterns and different ways of approaching a problem, some might be correct some might be wrong. Try to compare different approaches to find what is better according to you.\nM10 and M20 refers to the min_cluster_size hyperparameter used with the clustering algorithm.\nNote: These cluster/Pattern labels are generated using Large Language Models, which can be incorrect sometimes.\n\n\n\nProblem Name\nM20 Clusters\nM10 Clusters (has fine grained patterns)\n\n\n\n\nIncrement Value Of Key In Dict With Max Limit\nM20\nM10\n\n\nCheck Positive Odd Or Negative Even\nM20\nM10\n\n\nLast Word In A Given Sentence That Starts With Uppercase Letter\nM20\nM10\n\n\nCount Positive Integers Ignoring None\nM20\nM10\n\n\nUpper Case Only Vowels Cluster\nM20\nM10\n\n\nFind Sum And Absolute Difference Alternately\nM20\nM10\n\n\nStudent Marks Filter\nM20\nM10\n\n\nMatrix Walk Cluster\nM20\nM10\n\n\nPrint Pattern - V\nM20\nM10\n\n\nPattern Print - N\nM20\nM10"
